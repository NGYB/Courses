\f0\fs28 \cf2 The method works because\cf3 \'a0\cf2 the competition organizer did not provide all possible pairs in the test set.\cf3 \'a0\cf2 There is always some nonrandom subsampling in the test set, and\cf3 \'a0\cf2 this subsampling is the cause of data leakage.\cf3 \'a0\cf2 What we did is to create a connectivity matrix N times N,\cf3 \'a0\cf2 where N is the total number of items.\cf3 \'a0\cf2 If item i and item j appeared in a pair then we place 1 in i,\cf3 \'a0\cf2 j and j, i positions.\cf3 \'a0\cf2 Now, we can treat the rows in connectivity matrix as vector representations for\cf3 \'a0\cf2 every item.\cf3 \'a0\cf2 This means that we can compute similarities between those vectors using dot product.\cf3  \cf2 If the 2 items belong to the same group, then the dot product value will be high.\cf3 \
